# Virtual Try-On Feature

## Overview
The Virtual Try-On feature allows users to upload a selfie and see how YourFit clothing items would look on them. This AI-powered feature enhances the shopping experience by giving customers confidence in their purchase decisions.

## How It Works
1. Users click the Virtual Try-On button (shirt icon) in the navigation bar
2. They upload a selfie or drag and drop a photo
3. They select from available clothing items to try on
4. The AI generates a composite image showing how the item would look on them
5. Users can view before/after comparisons and add items directly to cart

## Technical Implementation
The feature is implemented using:
- React for the front-end interface
- AI image processing (simulated in the current version)
- Tabs component for before/after comparison
- Dialog component for the modal interface

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a real AI service for accurate try-on visualization
- Support for multiple items at once (complete outfits)
- Size recommendations based on body measurements
- Color variants for each item
- Sharing capabilities to social media

## Usage Notes
- The current implementation is a proof of concept that simulates the AI processing
- For the best experience, users should upload front-facing photos with good lighting
- The feature works best with clothing items rather than accessories

## Development
To expand this feature, modify the VirtualTryOn.tsx component and implement a real AI service for image processing.
